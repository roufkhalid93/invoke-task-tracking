INVOKE Task Tracker App

Notes:
1. I implemented MERN stack to complete this project.
2. You can run both backend and frontend locally to test out the application. Instead of using CORS, I add proxy to to package.json file on frontend folder to go around the cross origin issue.
3. The details information would be emailed to you privately to enable database access.

Till then, enjoy the weekend and happy Chinese New Year in advance!
